# 🗣️ OpenFloor

### Debate. Deliberate. Decide.

**OpenFloor** is a modern web platform for hosting and participating in structured, user-facilitated debates. Designed for students, educators, and debate enthusiasts, it offers a clean, fast, and engaging space to explore ideas, justify stances, and make persuasive arguments.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙 **Start or Join Debates**  
  Create debates on predefined topics or jump into existing public ones. Easily toggle between public and private formats to suit your requirements.

- 🧭 **Structured Debate Roles**  
  Every debate has a _Creator_, _Admins_, _Debaters_, and _Observers_. Roles help streamline the experience, each with their own permissions, and ensure fairness in argument flow.

- ✍️ **Stance + Justification Model**  
  Users can choose from a variety of user-defined stances and write long-form justifications that are independently viewable and votable. This structure encourages deeper critical thinking and flexible debate structuring.

- 👍 **Community Voting**  
  Readers and participants can upvote well-reasoned justifications and comments, influencing the visibility of strong arguments.

- 💬 **Commenting System**  
  Threaded comment chains beneath justifications enable discussion, clarifications, and counterpoints, all without disrupting the formal structure of the debate.

- 🔐 **Public vs Private Debates**  
  Set debates to private and invite specific participants for closed sessions — ideal for classrooms, clubs, or practice rounds.

- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**  
  Personalized visual breakdowns of your contributions: number of debates joined, justifications written, votes received, and trends over time.

- 🎯 **Topic Discovery**  
  Explore trending or most-discussed topics, with topic pages showing active debates and engagement stats.

- 🔄 **Role-Based Interface**  
  The UI dynamically adapts to your current role in a debate — whether you're a participant, judge, or an outside observer.

- 🧪 **Realistic Test Data (Dev Only)**  
  A seeded database with realistic users, topics, debates, and voting behavior is included to assist with development and testing.
